# Welcome and Introduction to DHRI@SMU 2019
*a Foundational Approach to Digital Humanities Research

As part of our welcome process, we’ll provide some of the history of the project, review the schedule,establish the objectives for the Institute, and ask participants to engage in an introductions and ice breaker activity. We’ll review the objectives and the schedule for the next few days, sort out pedagogical practices, and set our ambitious course for our time together. Everything we do throughout the institute is collaboratively and community-driven. 

#Goals 

* Digital Humanities Research Institute approach attendees should come to understand how this learning environment is designed to work. 
* This is essential because it will let them know what to expect and how to get the most out of this experience. (These are the rules, norms, and goals.)
* While the lesson may be individualized the learning experience will be collective. 
* Our goal is that you are more comfortable asking and answering questions, not that you will always know the answer. 
* By the end of the week they will not be digital humanities experts but they will be on their way to become full participants in a digital humanities community.

## Pedagogical approach
"The DHRI curriculum places great emphasis on foundational technical skills, and roughly one-third of all sessions at the Institute could be described as foundational. ... The difference between an instrumental approach and a foundational approach is often not immediately appreciated by participants, but over time they begin to change their minds. Although an instrumental approach satisfies a researcher’s most immediate need, a foundational approach takes into consideration the long term impact that learning core skills will have for the future professional and research needs of the scholar.

[DHRI: Notes toward our pedagogical approach by Lisa Rhody, June 17, 2019](https://www.lisarhody.com/dhri-notes-toward-our-pedagogical-approach/)

* We explain why understanding grounding principles in how computers work, in what it means to work from the command line, in learning the principles behind good practices for sharing documents, about how coding works, (what databases are), and how coding can be used to search, sort, count, and cluster in ways that can be helpful for humanistic research. 
* There is a lot that personal computers allow us to take for granted when we do our work; however, knowing fundamentals can help humanities scholars become more confident users and critics of digital technologies. 
* Such knowledge leads not only to becoming a better self-teacher, but to more reflective and informed technology choices. It allows us to save time in creating projects when we know what a well-formed dataset should or could look like, when we know what the difference is between using proprietary software rather than open source, and what kind of support might be needed as projects grow. 

# Why use Communities of Practice (CoP) set up? 
*CoP is the structure of this workshop series 
* it means working together to improve everyone’s learning.
* By participating in the activities with their fellow attendees they will simulate the work done by digital humanists

# The pedagogical logics of each workshop session, and how we expect them to build on each other 

*Introductions to communities of practice and how to determine what kinds of DH you want to do, and what skills that woudl necassiate or what partner you then need to seek out. (No DH project is an island, unless maybe it is a veeeeeeery small island) 

*Command line is to understand the structure of computers and their logic, so when you set up tools in the future, you can set them up to be useful for what you are trying to do. The goal is that when you are setting up environments in something like Rstudio (and it asks you about regrex), you can make informed choices about the settings. 

*Git is logic of versioning of collaborative works as programmers do it, so you can not worry about losing data, collaborative work. 

*Tools: such as even Zotero or Voyant, when a tool or program asks you to set up an environemnt or chosse specific setting, you understand that a question is being asked that will shape the answers/results you get, and you can answer it, or you know that you can ask someone to help you answer.

*Note: Skill in programming or tools only grows when you are using them to complete a project (skill building is usually project-based).

*To build a complete project/expertise is beyond the scope of this institute, but we want to help you build the foundation, and perhaps even an outline of your goal. We want to help you get to a point where you are comfortable figuring it (stack exchange) or you know when you have a question, how to phrase it and find the expertise you want to draw upon (community of practice)
