Introducing DHRI & a Foundational Approach to Digital Humanities Research

In this session, we discuss the Digital Humanities Research Institute approach to learning computational skills as humanists. We explain why understanding grounding principles in how computers work, in what it means to work from the command line, in learning the principles behind good practices for sharing documents, about how coding works, what databases are, and how coding can be used to search, sort, count, and cluster in ways that can be helpful for humanistic research. There is a lot that personal computers allow us to take for granted when we do our work; however, knowing fundamentals can help humanities scholars become more confident users and critics of digital technologies. Such knowledge leads not only to becoming a better self-teacher, but to more reflective and informed technology choices. It allows us to save time in creating projects when we know what a well-formed dataset should or could look like, when we know what the difference is between using proprietary software rather than open source, and what kind of support might be needed as projects grow. Weâ€™ll review the objectives and the schedule for the next 8 days, sort out pedagogical practices, and set our ambitious course for our time togethe
