# Welcome and Introductions

As part of our welcome process, we’ll provide some of the history of the project, review the schedule, establish the objectives for the Institute, and ask participants to engage in an introductions and ice breaker activity. Everything we do throughout the institute is collaboratively and community-driven. Therefore, we spend ample time at the beginning getting to know one another, our research interests, and the communities we work in and support. ....In this section, attendees should come to understand how this learning environment is designed to work. This is essential because it will let them know what to expect and how to get the most out of this experience. While the lesson may be individualized the learning experience will be collective. 
* By the end of the week they will not be digital humanities experts but they will be on their way to become full participants in a digital humanities community.
