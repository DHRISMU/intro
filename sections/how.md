# How did they do that? 

*"Many students tell me that in order to get started with digital humanities, they’d like to have some idea of what they might do and what technical skills they might need in order to do it." [by Miriam Posner](http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that/   )

computational & humanities thinking “how did they do that”
How to ask questions? What questions you can ask?

How do you read a project to see what went into it?
Like reading a bibliography
*How many articles listed? 
*How many people? Who is given attribution? 	
*Credits at the end of the movie 
*Affordances & limitations 

Exercise: Taking existing models and adapting it to your field (give them some examples, how would it apply to their field?)

# How do you do that? 
*Not going to be good at everything, what is your area of focus, and what do you know you need help with?
