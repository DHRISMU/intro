# What is Digital humanities?  
* Digital humanities is inherently collaborative 
* Digital humanities as interdisciplinary field 
* What is the importance of community in Digital Humanities? How that might differ from other types of scholarly communities.

In this section, attendees should come to understand how to define DH (in a way that is useful for them). This is essential because DH is so many things, what definition is useful for their research and scholarship. 

## There are many ways to define DH. 
* [What is digital humanities](https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/)

*“At its core digital humanities is more akin to a common methodological outlook than an investment in  any one specific set of texts or even technologies.... Yet digital humanities is also a social undertaking. It harbors networks of people who have been working together, sharing research, arguing, competing, and collaborating for many years.... a culture that values collaboration, openness, nonhierarchical relations, and agility” - [Matthew G. Kirschenbaum in his article “What Is Digital Humanities and What's It Doing in English Departments?](https://mkirschenbaum.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/kirschenbaum_ade150.pdf) 

* Rafia's working definition is: any humanities inquiry where you use computational methods 

#'What isn't DH?

*"If all this can be DH, maybe we want to say, fine, what isn't DH? I find that question difficult to answer concisely or usefully?"*

# What makes up Digital (or computational) + Humanities ?

## what is humanities thinking ?
* How would you define the humanities? 
* What are humanities methodologies? 
* What are humanities questions?

## What is computational thinking ?

*Command thinking (Intro to computer science, STS, etc.) 
(Add link to artificial unintelligence here, think like a computer/ like in search, think like a database)

"Computational thinking is a pattern of problem solving that involves organizing and analyzing data, abstracting in search of patterns, and breaking complex problems into discrete, solvable parts (Jeannette Wing, 2006, doi: 10.1145/1118178.1118215). It enables humanities researchers to formulate new questions and to think through how to leverage both data and computational processes to explore those questions. While these skills may be taught in the context of a particular programming language, in our case Python, the patterns of thought are transferable to any language or computational process."
